            A project will provide you the opportunity to explore and experience software testing in practice. There are two options, please choose only one option: (1) test generation project — to provide you the opportunity to design and automate tests for a software project, (2) position paper — to expose you to advanced topics and challenges in software testing and give you the opportunity to learn more about an area of your interest. You may work on the project individually or with one partner.

             This project focuses on transitioning from concepts to practice. It allows you to demonstrate that you have achieved the objectives of this course by applying the testing coverage criteria to design tests and automate them for a software project.
			<br><br>
			At a high level, this project will require you to:
			<ul>
			<li>Select a subject under test and set up the testing environment.</li>
			<li>Document your subject under test.</li>
			<li>Prepare the testing tool(s).</li>
			<li>Document your testing environment.</li>
			<li>Choose the coverage criteria and design tests.</li>
			<li>Automate your tests and execute them.</li>
			<li>Document and analyze your tests.</li>
			<li>Reflect on the code coverage of your test suite.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			On Blackboard, you will find a detailed outline of the requirements for this project.

          <p>
             The intention of this position paper is to expose you to advanced topics and challenges in software testing and give you an opportunity to learn more about an area of your interest.
			<br><br>
			At a high level, this project will require you to:
			<ul>
			<li>Select a challenge to focus on from the 6 vision papers related to software testing.</li>
			<li>Develop an outline of your paper.</li>
			<li>Develop an abstract.</li>
			<li>Develop your position paper. IEEE's LaTex format is available on blackboard.</li>
			<li>Your paper must include an introduction, survey of the literature or related work, your position and discussion (counter argument and your argument), conclusion, and references supporting your discussion.</li>
			</ul>
